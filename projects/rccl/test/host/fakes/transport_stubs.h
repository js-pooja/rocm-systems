// Seams whose definitions live in transport_stubs.cc. Declared in a header, not

//
// SCOPE: this rule covers what transport_stubs.cc OWNS. It does not retroactively
// cover the seams it merely CONSUMES -- g_ncclGetUserP2pLevel,
// g_ncclNvlsInitResult and g_ncclNvlsInitCalls are defined in init_fakes.cc and
// still hand-declared extern below, as they are in topo_stubs.cc, nccl_stubs.cc
// and bootstrap_stubs.cc. Giving those a header means moving them to a fakes
// file named after their owning production TU, which is a separate change.
