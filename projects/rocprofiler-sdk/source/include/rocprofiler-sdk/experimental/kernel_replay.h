/**
 * @brief ROCProfiler Kernel Replay Callback Tracer Record.
 *
 * Payload for @ref ROCPROFILER_CALLBACK_TRACING_KERNEL_REPLAY callbacks.
 * All members are present in the struct (no unions). Which members are meaningful
 * depends on the current operation:
 *
 * - @ref ROCPROFILER_KERNEL_REPLAY_CONFIG: @c dispatch_info is populated by the SDK.
 *   The tool sets @c replay_pass_count and optionally @c replay_continue during
 *   @ref ROCPROFILER_CALLBACK_PHASE_ENTER. Pass-info fields are zero.
 * - @ref ROCPROFILER_KERNEL_REPLAY_PASS: @c dispatch_info, @c current_pass, and
 *   @c total_passes are populated by the SDK. @c replay_pass_count reads as NULL and must not be
 *   modified (the pass count is fixed at CONFIG PHASE_ENTER). @c replay_continue is NULL during
 *   PASS PHASE_ENTER; during PASS PHASE_EXIT the SDK populates it with the callback in effect for
 *   this pass, and the tool may overwrite it there to change the continue decision for this pass
 *   only (the next pass reverts to the CONFIG default).
 *
 * The SDK maintains a single @c rocprofiler_user_data_t for the entire replay sequence
 * (CONFIG + all PASS operations). A tool can write per-dispatch state into
 * @c user_data during CONFIG PHASE_ENTER; the same value is delivered to every
 * subsequent PASS callback and to @c replay_pass_count and @c replay_continue for the
 * same dispatch.
 *
 * Each PASS receives its own copy of that value, so a write during a PASS callback is scoped to
 * the pass that performed it: that pass's PASS PHASE_EXIT and its @c replay_continue decision
 * observe the write, while the next PASS and CONFIG PHASE_EXIT still observe the value set during
 * CONFIG PHASE_ENTER. @c replay_continue runs after PASS PHASE_EXIT and receives that pass's copy
 * (the value its PHASE_EXIT left), not the CONFIG value. For state that must persist across the
 * whole sequence regardless of per-pass writes, place it behind @c user_data.ptr: mutating the
 * pointed-to object is visible from every callback, whereas overwriting the union value is
 * per-pass. See `samples/kernel_replay/basic_client_with_user_data.cpp` for a worked example.
 *
 * Exactly one context may configure a KERNEL_REPLAY service; a second
 * @ref rocprofiler_configure_callback_tracing_service for this domain returns
 * @ref ROCPROFILER_STATUS_ERROR_SERVICE_ALREADY_CONFIGURED.
 *
 * @warning Beta. A dispatch is replayed only when its submission is a single packet containing a
 * single dispatch. HIP graph launches are not replayed, and a multi-packet submission runs once
 * without replay; each case warns once. Repeatability rests on a snapshot covering coarse-grained
 * device allocations owned by the agent plus module-scope @c __device__ / @c __constant__
 * variables. Unified or managed memory, @c hipMallocAsync and other virtual-memory-mapped
 * allocations, and host, fine-grained and kernarg memory are not captured, so a kernel writing to
 * them observes values accumulated across passes rather than identical inputs. Allocations carrying
 * @c HSA_AMD_MEMORY_POOL_EXECUTABLE_FLAG are excluded from the snapshot (HIP kernarg pools /
 * profiler buffers share that flag). A direct-HSA application that puts ordinary writable device
 * data behind the same flag sees the same omission -- an unsupported allocation class for beta.
 * Declining every replay while any such trackable allocation is live is not viable because the HIP
 * runtime itself keeps them live under interception. A failed restore aborts the process rather
 * than continuing with partially restored memory.
 *
 * @see `docs/how-to/using-kernel-replay.rst` for the full limitation list and
 * `docs/conceptual/kernel_replay/kernel_replay_memory_snapshot.md` for what the snapshot covers
 * and why.

    ///    collection and SPM consult the override on every dispatch (and likewise refuse to
    ///    promote a globally stopped context). PC sampling is agent-wide and device counting
    ///    is not dispatch-scoped, so neither consults the override at all -- a call naming
    ///    such a context reports success but has no effect.
