# Checks the built library's dynamic symbol table for the Dxg* entry points.
#
# The version script is text, not the library. Nothing else in this directory
# links or loads librocdxg either - the refcount test compiles a header on its
# own. So the one thing that decides whether ROCr's dlsym() finds these symbols,
# the dynamic symbol table of the artifact we ship, had no test at all.
#
# The regression this exists to catch: an entry point's C linkage comes from a
# declaration, not from its definition. Lose the declaration and the definition
# still compiles, but as a local C++ symbol - the version script's unmangled
# name then matches nothing, the dynamic table loses the entry, and ROCr's
# dlsym() returns NULL at runtime. Every text-level check still passes.
#
# Names are given by the caller rather than parsed out of the header or the
# version script, so that deleting one from either is a failure here.
#
# Expects LIBRARY, NM, EXPECTED_VERSION and EXPECTED_SYMBOLS on the command
# line, the last comma-separated so it survives being passed as one -D argument.
