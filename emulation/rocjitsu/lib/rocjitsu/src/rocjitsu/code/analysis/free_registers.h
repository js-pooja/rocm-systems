/// @param unavailable Registers that must not be selected. Its meaning is the

/// @param cls Register class to search. Must be one RegisterSet models --
///        SGPR, VGPR, or ACC_VGPR. RegisterSet::intersects() answers false for
///        every other class, so searching one would report the whole space free.
/// @param count Number of consecutive registers required; must be non-zero. The
///        type is RegisterRef::width's, since the candidate run is tested as one
///        RegisterRef -- a wider run cannot be named and so cannot be searched
///        for.
/// @param search_start Lowest candidate base. Rounded up to @p base_alignment.
/// @param base_alignment Required tuple-base alignment; must be a non-zero power
///        of two. Host operands that name a register pair need an even base.
/// @param bound Exclusive upper limit: the whole run must satisfy
///        `base + count <= bound`.
/// @returns The lowest qualifying base, or nullopt when the bound leaves none.
